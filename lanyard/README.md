# Lanyard Kit Assembly and Use

If you received an LED lanyard kit to use at the Teardown 2023 workshop, it should contain the following components:
 - [LilyGo T-OI Plus board](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-oi-plus?variant=42306652143797) with female header pins pre-soldered
 - Rechargeable cylindrical 16340 Li-Ion battery (3.7V)
 - [LED string containing 20 LEDs with 5mm spacing](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805296356090.html) with attached Grove connector
 - USB C data cable
 - MAX4466 Electret microphone amplifier with hookup wire
 - 1m (approx) length of drawstring cord
 - 3D printed case and lid for the LilyGo T-OI board and battery
 - 2mm wide zip-ties
 
 The lid of the 3D printed case slides over the case-rails as shown below:

 To assemble the lanyard, first slide the drawstring cord over the LED string, starting at the end without the connector. Push the string into the cord, bunching it up them smoothing it out to pull the cord through. The cord is longer than the LED strong. Stop pushing when it reaches the Grove connector.

 With the T-IO fully inserted into the 3D printed case, nsert the Grove connector into the corresponding connector on the T-OI board. Holding the cord in place over the lanyard, bend the LED string underneath the board and bring it up through the open hook on the opposite side of the case. Use a zip tie to fasten the LED string and cord to the hook to provide strain relief.

 Take the loose end of the cord and LED string and trim the excess cord off at the end of the LED string. Smooth out the LED string to make sure it isn't twisted, and insert the loose end, covered with the cord into the other hook on the case. Use a zip tie to attach the LED string + cord to the case.

 Insert the battery into the holder on the T-OI board. Look carefully for the "+" and "-" markings to ensure the polarity is correct. Slide the 3D printed lid over the case along the rails to hold the battery in place.

 The battery will charge when 5V power is connected through the board's USB connector. There is a slide switch near the reset button that turns the board's power on and off.
