# "LED Animations with CircuitPython" workshop at [Teardown 2023](https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2023)

## Workshop Info

### **Please bring a laptop with the [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) pre-installed.**

We will assemble and code an LED lanyard controlled by the [LilyGo T-OI Plus](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-oi-plus?variant=42306652143797) board. This board is useful for wearables because it contains a charging circuit and holder for a 16340 LiIon battery, an on-off switch, as well as a Grove Pin adapter, which we will use to attach a section of [LED string containing 20 LEDs with 5mm spacing](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805296356090.html).
